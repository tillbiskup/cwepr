The cwEPR package provides tools for handling experimental data obtained using continuous-wave EPR (cwEPR) spectroscopy and is derived from the `ASpecD framework <https://www.aspecd.de/>`_. Due to inheriting from the ASpecD superclasses, all data generated with the cwepr package are completely reproducible and have a complete history.

What is even better: Actual data processing and analysis **no longer requires programming skills**, but is as simple as writing a text file summarising all the steps you want to have been performed on your dataset(s) in an organised way. Curious? Have a look at the following example::

    default_package: cwepr

    datasets:
      - /path/to/first/dataset
      - /path/to/second/dataset

    tasks:
      - kind: processing
        type: FrequencyCorrection
        properties:
          parameters:
            frequency: 9.8
      - kind: processing
        type: BaselineCorrection
        properties:
          parameters:
            order: 0
      - kind: singleplot
        type: SinglePlotter1D
        properties:
          filename:
            - first-dataset.pdf
            - second-dataset.pdf

Features
--------

A list of features:

- Fully reproducible processing of cw-EPR data
- Import of EPR data from diverse sources (Bruker ESP, EMX, Elexsys; Magnettech)
- Generic plotting capabilities, easily extendable
- Report generation using pre-defined templates
- Recipe-driven data analysis, allowing tasks to be performed fully unattended in the background

And to make it even more convenient for users and future-proof:

- Open source project written in Python (>= 3.5)
- Extensive user and API documentation


.. warning::
  The cwEPR package is currently under active development and still considered in Beta development state. Therefore, expect frequent changes in features and public APIs that may break your own code. Nevertheless, feedback as well as feature requests are highly welcome.


Target audience
---------------

The cwepr package addresses scientists working with cwEPR data (both, measured and calculated) on a daily base and concerned with `reproducibility <https://www.reproducible-research.de/>`_. Due to being based on the `ASpecD framework <https://www.aspecd.de/>`_, the cwepr package ensures reproducibility and---as much as possible---replicability of data processing, starting from recording data and ending with their final (graphical) representation, e.g., in a peer-reviewed publication. This is achieved by automatically creating a gap-less record of each operation performed on your data. If you do care about reproducibility and are looking for a system that helps you to achieve this goal, the cwepr package may well be interesting for you.


Related projects
