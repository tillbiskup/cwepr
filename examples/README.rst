This directory contains a list of subdirectories with each a working example recipe highlighting a particular aspect of data processing and analysis.

The datasets used are stored within the tests directory and used for testing  the importers. If you have cloned the repository, the recipes should work "out of the box", as they always contain the relative path to the data.
