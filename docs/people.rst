Who are the people behind the cwEPR package?

The first version of the cwEPR package was implemented by Pascal Kirchner during his internship and masters thesis in 2018/19 at the University of Freiburg, supervised by Till Biskup, the author of the `ASpecD framework <https://www.aspecd.de/>`_ and maintainer of the cwEPR package.

In autumn 2020, partly due to personal needs of the maintainer, development resumed, and Mirjam Schr√∂der joined the development team. During this development and partial rewrite, portions of code from the `trEPR package <https://docs.trepr.de/>`_ authored by J. Popp have been inherited.
