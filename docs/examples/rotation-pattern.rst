Rotation pattern
================

When performing angular-dependent EPR measurements, *i.e.* recording rotation patterns, it is of particular importance to have a well-crafted graphical representation that provides access to all crucial information at once. This includes different ways of displaying the rotation pattern as well as overlaying two traces recorded with an angular difference of 180Â°. Due to the physics underlying magnetic resonance, those two signals should be identical (at least in shape), and if not, this is a good hint that something went wrong.

The cwepr package provides a special plotter, the :class:`cwepr.plotting.GoniometerSweepPlotter`, particularly designed for this purpose. Therefore, getting an overview of an angular-dependent measurement is a matter of only a single plotting operation, only preceded by a baseline correction.

In this case, only a baseline correction is performed, no frequency correction, as spectra are primarily compared within one measurement. If you would like to compare different rotation patterns, consider adding a frequency correction as well.
